Coronapolation

Idea: 
The spread of the corona virus is picking up speed and we are facing a phase where single infection chains can not be traced anymore. 
All across germany different messures are employed but so far the impact is unclear and hard to monitor. 

We want to aggregate information from the RKI regarding corona infections, complement the dataset with various other 
data sources (e.g. weather data, usage of public transport, etc.), to have a basis for an extrapolation. 

On this data basis we can deploy models with measures for stopping further spreading. This models can than be verified 
on the one hand with our system by looking into the past and we can start to extrapolate and give an idicator for the sensibility 
for those measures.

Implementation:
